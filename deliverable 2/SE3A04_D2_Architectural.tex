\section{Architectural Design}
\label{sec:architectural_design}
% Begin Section
This section should provide an overview of the overall architectural design of your application. Your overall architecture should show the division of the system into subsystems with high cohesion and low coupling.

\subsection{System Architecture}
\label{sub:system_architecture}
% Begin SubSection
\begin{itemize}
	\item Identify and explain the overall architecture of your system
	\item Be sure to clearly state the name of the architecture you used (this is the name of the architectural pattern, not the name of your system)
	\item Provide the reasoning and justification of the choice of architecture
	\item Provide a structural architecture diagram showing the relationship among the subsystems (if appropriate)
	\item List any design alternatives you considered, but eliminated (and explain why you eliminated them)
\end{itemize}
% End SubSection

\subsection{Subsystems}
\label{sub:subsystems}
% Begin SubSection
 Provide a list of your subsystems, with a brief description of each. Be sure to document its purpose and relationship to other subsystems.
